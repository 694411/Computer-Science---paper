# Computer Science -paper
Python code used for research paper - Computer Science

The code is divided in 8 parts:
  - Data (loading, cleaning, preparing)
  - Model Words (extracting model words from product descriptions)
  - Binary Vectors (constructing the binary vectors for each product)
  - Min-Hashing (constructing the signature matrix)
  - Locality-Sensitive Hashing (identifying candidate duplicate pairs)
  - Jaccard Similarity
  - Bootstrapping training 
  - Bootstrapping testing

The code is provided with a lot of comments, making all steps as clear as possible. There is no need to switch between documents, all code is provided in one file.
